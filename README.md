# AMP-Parkinson's Disease Progression Prediction Project

## Project Overview
- **Title:** AMP-Parkinson's Disease Progression Prediction
- **Authors:** Fraol Abebe, Mitch Breeden, John Gullette, Jason Pinto, Ryan Wadsworth
- **Course:** OR-568-002
- **Institution:** George Mason University
- **Date:** 5/14/2023

## Project Description
Objective: Predict Parkinson's disease progression using protein and peptide data, contributing to the understanding and management of the disease.

## Data Sources
- Protein and peptide datasets. https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/amp-parkinsons-disease-progression-prediction/data
- Data collected and processed for predictive modeling.

## Methodology
- **Tools Used:** Python, Jupyter Notebook, Google Colab, Ridge Regression, Random Forest Regression.
- **Features:** Handling null values, data cleaning, predictive modeling.
- **Approach:** Use of advanced statistical and machine learning techniques for disease progression prediction.

## Results and Conclusions
- Evaluation of model performance.
- Insight into the significance of different predictors in Parkinson's disease progression.
