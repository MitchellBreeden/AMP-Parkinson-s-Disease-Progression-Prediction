## Project Description
Objective: Predict Parkinson's disease progression using protein and peptide data, contributing to the understanding and management of the disease.

## Data Sources
- Data downloadable via [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/amp-parkinsons-disease-progression-prediction/data)
- `train_clinical_data.csv`: Clinical records with symptoms and medication information for training.
- `train_peptides.csv`: Mass spectrometry data at the peptide level.
- `train_proteins.csv`: Protein expression frequencies aggregated from the peptide level data.

## Methodology
- **Tools Used:** Python, Jupyter Notebook, Google Colab, Ridge Regression, Random Forest Regression.
- **Features:** Handling null values, data cleaning, predictive modeling.
- **Approach:** Use of advanced statistical and machine learning techniques for disease progression prediction.

## Results and Conclusions
- Evaluation of model performance.
- Insight into the significance of different predictors in Parkinson's disease progression.
